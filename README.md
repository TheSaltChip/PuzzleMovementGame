# PuzzleMovementGame
 
This repository contains the code for our VR game, which was created as part of our master's thesis in software development.
The game is a collection of different mini-games, with four mini-games implemented at the end of the thesis.

The code in this repo is a Unity project on Unity version 2021.3.30f1 with URP. You need to download that version of Unity to open this project without issues.

### Branches
Release-master-thesis-version is the final version of this game for the master thesis.

Eval1 is how the game was at the time of the first evaluation.

Eval2 is how the game was at the time of the second evaluation.

Pre-release-v1 is how the game was at the first presentation with physiotherapists before Christmas 2023.
